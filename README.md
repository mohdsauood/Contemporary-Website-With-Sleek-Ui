## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wanted to create a Strong Desktop Design with a futuristic appeal to it .With the introduction of Css grid it has become easy to create a responsive website.To make it challening i wanted to create the design also suitable it for Internet Explorer 11.So i avoided use Css Grid or any Frameworks as Internet Explorer 11 Doesnt Support it and used Plain Css Positioning to create an Interactive Webdesign.For the Mobile ViewPort i used javascript to create a menu button to display the navigation menu.The Design is Sleek and elegant which makes the brand/product stand out.

## Lessons Learned:

Any Complex Modern Web Design could be created using Only Css Positioning.My understanding of Relative and Absolute positions increased with creating an entire website using these positions.Implenting Gradient Backgrounds was interesting to Learn.
